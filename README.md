# Green Coverage and Accessibility Analysis in Valencia

This project analyzes the availability and accessibility of green zones in Valencia using spatial data on census tracts and green areas. The focus is on evaluating green space distribution, accessibility, and its relationship with socioeconomic status.

## Project Overview

This study utilizes spatial data on census tracts and green zones to conduct a comprehensive analysis of green coverage and its accessibility in Valencia. The following are the key objectives:

- **Green Coverage Per Capita**: Analyzing the distribution of green spaces per person in each census tract, in accordance with the standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).
- **Accessibility Index**: Calculating the accessibility to green areas using the 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method, which accounts for population density, green area sizes, and distances between census tracts and green zones.
- **Hot Spot Analysis**: Identifying hot spots and cold spots of green coverage using spatial autocorrelation techniques.
- **Socioeconomic Correlation**: Explore the relationship between green coverage and socioeconomic indicators such as income and education.

## Data Sources

The data used for this project comes from the following sources:
- **Census and demographic data**: Retrieved from the [Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica](https://www.ine.es).
- **Green zones geospatial data**: Accessed via the [Geo Portal del Ayuntamiento de Valencia](https://valencia.opendatasoft.com/pages/home/) through an API.

## Methodology

The project is divided into several stages:

1. **Exploratory Green Coverage Analysis**:  
   - **Per Capita Availability of Green Space**: This metric is used to assess the adequacy of green spaces relative to the population density in each census tract. Areas with extremely high population density are identified, where additional green spaces may be required.

2. **Accessibility Analysis**:
   - **2SFCA Method**: Accessibility is measured using the 2-Step Floating Catchment Area (2SFCA) method, which factors in:
     - **Distances**: Manhattan distances between census tracts and green zones.
     - **Green Zone Areas**: Larger green spaces have higher scores.
     - **Catchment Area**: A 1000-meter isochrone is used to define the accessible area.
	 - **Population**: The population of census tracts is considered to determine how many people benefit from green spaces within the catchment area.

3. **Spatial Autocorrelation**:
   - **Hot Spot and Cold Spot Analysis**: Spatial autocorrelation analysis is applied to identify clusters of census tracts with high or low green coverage.

4. **Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)**:
   - **Relationship with Socioeconomic Status**: GWR is used to examine the potential correlation between green coverage and socioeconomic indicators such as income and education levels to assess disparities in access to green spaces across different neighborhoods.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Primary language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **GeoPandas**: For working with geospatial data.
- **PySAL**: For spatial autocorrelation and hot spot analysis.
- **GWR**: To perform geographically weighted regression.
- **APIs**: To retrieve data from public sources.
- **Spyder IDE**: Used for organizing code in different notebooks for data loading, exploration, and spatial analysis.

## Conclusion

The findings can be used by urban planners and policymakers to address inequalities in access to green spaces and to implement strategies to improve environmental conditions in densely populated areas. This project also highlights disparities between socioeconomic groups and their access to green spaces, encouraging equitable urban planning practices.
